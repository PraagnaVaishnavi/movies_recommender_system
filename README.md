The Movie Recommender System allows users to get movie recommendations based on a selected movie. The backend uses machine learning models to analyze movie similarities and provide recommendations, while the frontend is powered by Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the system easily.

Key Features:
Movie Search: Users can input the name of a movie and get recommendations based on similar movies.

Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the recommender system.

Movie Poster Display: The system fetches and displays movie posters for better visual experience.

Technologies Used
Python: For building the backend logic and data processing.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.

Scikit-learn: For the machine learning part of the recommendation system.

Pickle: For saving and loading pre-trained models and data.

TMDb API: For fetching movie details such as titles and posters.
